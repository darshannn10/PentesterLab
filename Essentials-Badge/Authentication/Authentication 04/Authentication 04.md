**GOAL**: TO get logged in as `admin` using String comparision misconfiguration

## Solution
1. Visiting the website, we can register through the registration form
2. We can't register with username `admin` as the user already exists
3. So we resgister as some other user, let's say `test`.
4. Another problem with `MySQL` is that it ignores trailing spaces, (i.e.: pentesterlab and pentesterlab[space] are equals)
5. Using this flaw, we can try to register as `admin[space]`, and hopefully get logged in as `admin`

## Database Scenario:

- Original Query: ```SELECT * FROM users where username = `admin`;```

- Misconfigured Query: ```SELECT * FROM users where username = `admin `;```

> Both will return the same results as the string `admin` and `admin ` are considered to be the same as it  `ignores trailing spaces`
