**GOAL**: TO get logged in as `admin` 

## Solution
1. Visiting the website, we can login through the login form
2. Howevevr We can't login with username `admin` or even with a username `test`
3. When you carefully watch the `url`, you notice that when we visit the homepage, we are automatically redirected to `/login.php`
4. Viewing the `response` of the pages in `Burp` you can obtain the key to the exercise

Another way to get the key is to use the `curl` command to retrieve the contents of the page
```curl <website-link>```
