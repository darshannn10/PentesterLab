**GOAL**: TO get logged in as `admin`

## Solution
1. Visiting the website, we can register through the registration form
2. We can't register with username `admin` as the user already exists
3. So we resgister as some other user, let's say `test`
4. Checking the cooking of the registered user we see that the cookie value is exactly the same as username we registered with
5. In this way, we can shange the cookie value to `admin` to get logged in as a admin.
