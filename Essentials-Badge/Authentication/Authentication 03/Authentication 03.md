**GOAL**: TO get logged in as `admin` using String comparision misconfiguration

## Solution
1. Visiting the website, we can register through the registration form
2. We can't register with username `admin` as the user already exists
3. So we resgister as some other user, let's say `test`.
4. Like previous exercise, we can obtain the hashed cookie value and google or try to crack it, but it's of no use.
5. Since we can't login using `admin`, however we can abuse the `case-insensitive comparision`  of certain databases to login as `Admin` but actually get logged in as `admin` 
6. Once you do this, you're logged in as `admin` and are displayed the key to complete the exercise
