**GOAL**: TO get logged in as `admin`

## Solution
1. Visiting the website, we can register through the registration form
2. We can't register with username `admin` as the user already exists
3. So we register as some other user, let's say `test`
4. Once signed in, we can look at the value of cookie, we find out that there is a string of a random characters and numbers.
5. If you've seen some hashes, you could recognize that the string is a `MD5` hash
6. We can easily google `MD5 hash reverse` or crack the hash using a  password cracking tool   
7. Once you reverse it, you will find out that it is a `MD5` hash of your own username
8. In this way, you can hash the `admin` username in `MD5` and replace the value of the cookie in the same way.
