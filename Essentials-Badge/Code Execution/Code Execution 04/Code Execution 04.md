**GOAL**: To finish this exercise, you need to run the binary `/usr/local/bin/score UUID`

## Solution
1. Visiting the web-page, we see a generic format, the one which we have been seeing since the start.
2. Entering a `' (single quote)` in the URL confirms the presence of misconfiguration along with the key information `fatal error: assert()`.
3. We can use `'.'` to close the function and get rid of the error.
4. Further, we need to start adding parameters to retrieve information from the web-app.
5. We can get `php system info` by using the `phpinfo()` command in the following way: 
```
'.phpinfo().'
```
6. Now we can substitute `system(score command)` instead of `phpinfo()` and complete the exercise in the following way:
```
'.system('/usr/local/bin/score f11a5d9c-353f-40ae-89d6-75392618a2bd').'
```
