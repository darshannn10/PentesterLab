**GOAL**: To finish this exercise, you need to run the binary `/usr/local/bin/score UUID`

## Solution:
1. Visiting the web-page, we see a few coloumns and pressing on each column, we see that we can sort those results by the coloumn we click on. If we click on `name`, it'll we sorted by names, for example
2. Injecting a `' (single quote)` in the URL gives us a syntax error
3. The error reveals that the web-app is using the `usort()` fucntion to dynamically sort the results using the fuction user provides
4. In this web-app the dynamic fuction is the parameter we provide and thus we can abuse this feature by providing a parameter along with some system commands to execute
5. For example, instead of just sorting by name, sort by name and execute a command.
6. To close the fuction, we need to add `);` commands
7. Thus, using this `);` parameter we can end the fuction and so we can add the other commands we want the web-page to execute, and by adding `}//` we comment out the rest of the code.
```);}//```
8. To get the name of the system, we can enter the following command: 
```);}system('uname');//```
9. To complete the exercise, we enter the following command:
```
);}system('/usr/local/bin/score f11a5d9c-353f-40ae-89d6-75392618a2bd');//
```
