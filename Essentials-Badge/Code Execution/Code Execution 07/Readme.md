In the previous challenge, we made things a bit easier by importing `os` in the vulnerable application. However, we didn't for this challenge.

If we try to use `os.system('id')` for example. we get an error message.

This is likely due to the fact that the os module (that we need to access system) is not loaded. We can use the following syntax to load and run the system function:
```
`__import__('os').system(...`
```
Finally, by replacing our initial call to `id` with the `score` command, you should be able to score this exercise.
