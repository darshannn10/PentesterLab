**GOAL**: To finish this exercise, you need to run the binary `/usr/local/bin/score UUID`

## Solution
1. Visiting the web-page, we get redirected to `/hello/hacker` page.
2. We can try to add a parameter and a value but its of no use
3. Now, adding a `"` (double-quote) we get a `internal server error` confirming that we can perform a code execution
4. Further we can add url-encoded `+` to concatenate the string
5. We can inject some commands to check out if the code execution is working properly or not.
6. We can do this by following command: 
```
hacker"%2bstr(1%2b1)%2b"
```
Here we use `str()` function sinzae python doesnt allow mapping `int` with `strings`
7. Further we can complete this exercise by replacing the `str(1+1)` with the `os.system()` command and passing in the commands.
```
hacker"%2bstr(__import__('os').system('id'))%2b"
```

```
hacker"%2bstr(os.system('/usr/local/bin/score f11a5d9c-353f-40ae-89d6-75392618a2bd'))%2b"
```
