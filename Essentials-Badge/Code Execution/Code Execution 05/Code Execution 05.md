**GOAL**: To finish this exercise, you need to run the binary `/usr/local/bin/score UUID`

## Solution
1. Since it is a Ruby application, we can cause a syntax error by using a double-quote `"`
2. The error displayed on the page helps in revealing a lot of information but the most important of all is the presence of `eval()` function
3. according the given information in the course, we can concatenate the strings by using `+` sign which needs to be url-encoded.
4. By doing it, the final command to complete the exercise is: 
```
"%2b`/usr/local/bin/score UUID`%2b"
```
