In this exercise, we are dealing with a `Ruby` application, which you will be able to quickly tell by `injecting a double quote` in the username parameter.

Since the application is in development mode, we get a lot of details on the error. The following line is especially interesting:
```ruby
@message = eval "\"Hello "+params['username']+"\""
```
We can see that we are injecting in a call to `eval`.

Always remember: eval is evil.

Here, we will need to do the following:

- A double-quote `"` to break out of the string.
- Add a `+` sign for string concatenation (don't forget to URL-encode it)
- Add a call to the command ([COMMAND]) we want to run using `[COMMAND]`.
- Add another `+` sign for string concatenation.
- Another double-quote `"` to close the one that was already there.

Once we put everything together, we should be able to run the score command.
