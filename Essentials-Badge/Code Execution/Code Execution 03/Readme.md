We talked earlier about regular expression modifiers with multi-line regular expression.

Another very dangerous modifier exists in PHP: `PCRE_REPLACE_EVAL (/e)`.

This modifier will cause the function `preg_replace` to evaluate the new value as PHP code, before performing the substitution.

```NOTE: PCRE_REPLACE_EVAL has been deprecated as of PHP 5.5.0```

Here, you will need to change the pattern, by adding the `/e` modifier. Once you have added this modifier, you should get a notice:

```
Notice: Use of undefined constant hacker - assumed 'hacker' in /var/www/codeexec/example3.php(3) : regexp code on line 1
```

The function `preg_replace` tries to evaluate the value `hacker` as a constant, but as it is not defined, you get this error message.

You can easily replace `hacker` with a call to the function `phpinfo()` to get a visible result.

Once you can see the result of the `phpinfo` function, you can use the function `system` to run any command.
