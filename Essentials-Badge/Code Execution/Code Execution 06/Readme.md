In this exercise, we are dealing with a `Python` application.

Like our previous exercise, we can see that `injecting a double-quote` gives us an error.

First, let's see how we can properly close the double-quote.

We can inject a `+` (properly encoded) and another `double-quote` to get a response without error.

Now, we need to make sure it's a Python application. For this, we can use:

`"%2bstr(True)%2b"test`

The fact that both `str()` and `True` are available give us a pretty good chance that Python is used. For the rest of the challenge, we will put our payload inside the call to `str()`.

Now, we want to get to code execution. We can try to use `os.system('id')` for example.

We can see a `0` coming back in the response. This shows that the command was executed successfully. If you try an invalid command like hacker, you will get `32512` meaning that the process returned `127` (since the command is not found).

It may also be valuable to get the value returned by the command. To do this, you can use: `os.popen('[CMD]').read()` instead of `os.system('[CMD]').`

Finally, by changing the call to id to the `/usr/local/bin/score UUID` command, you should be able to score this exercise.
