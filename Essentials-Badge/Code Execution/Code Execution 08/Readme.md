# Course
This challenge is very similar to the previous challenge.

The previous challenge allowed `/` in the path, since the following Flask route was used:
```python
@app.route('/hello/')
```

This challenge prevents us from using `/` in the path, since the following route is used:
```python
@app.route('/hello/user')
```
This is obviously something you can only guess by trial and error. We can go back to the previous payload using ls and it will work. However, we can't run `/usr/local/bin/score` (since we need a /).

To bypass this issue, we can use `base64` encoding.

We will send a `base64 encoded command` to the server (to avoid the / in the path), and tell the server to decode it using the function b64decode.

The call to b64decode will be done by the server as part of our payload. However, unfortunately the base64 module is not loaded, so we will need to use the `__import__` trick to load base64.

Finally, the command to score will need to be base64-encoded before being sent to the server (so the payload can decode it).
