This challenge is code injection in `Perl`.

The Perl script is deployed as a CGI script. You can quickly get a better understanding of how the site works by inspecting the traffic. First the index page is loaded, then it does a request to the CGI in JavaScript.

As always, you can use single or double quotes to trigger unexpected behaviour in the application.

Once you find which one is used, you should be able to gain command execution using backticks or one of the Perl functions used to run a command (`system`, `exec`).

Once you are able to run commands like `uname`, you should be able to score this exercise.
