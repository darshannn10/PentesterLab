**GOAL**: To finish this exercise, you need to run the binary `/usr/local/bin/score UUID`

## Solution
1. Visiting the web-page, we can directly change the url with numbers or words, and there is no parameter.
2. But using the advanced developer options and going to the networks' tab we see that there is the parameter that we saw in previous exercises and all these changes are happening inside that framework which is not visible to the users
3. We can copy the url and directly paste it and visit that website. We can then view a `json` file which is dynamic in nature.
4. Changing the url also changes the result displayed on the web-page
5. Finally, we can complete the exercise by entering these commands:
```
/cgi-bin/hello?name=hacker%27.`/usr/local/bin/score UUID`.%27
```
