## Solution
- Visiting the website and trying common credentials, we get an `Invalid credentials` error.
- Here, its about using a special character `%bf%27`, this is due to the way the escaping is done in PHP.
- So, Using Burp and sending the request to the repeater and using the following payload:
```
admin%bf%27
```
