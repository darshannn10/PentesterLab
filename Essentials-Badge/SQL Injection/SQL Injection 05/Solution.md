## Solution
- Visiting the webpage and trying to login through comman credentials (admin:admin), I get an error.
- Using the basic ```admin' or 1=1 -- ```payload still gives an `ERROR NO SPACE` error.
- So, I jumped into `Burp`, sent the request to the `Repeater` URL encoded the request, replace the `space` with `%09` and sent it, and still got an error.
- So, now we need to find equivalances to these conditions by looking at the SQL document.
- Here, we can replace the `OR` with `|| (double pipes)` and replace the `--` by `#`
- So Now, we can URL encode these replaced values (`#` -> `%23`)
```
admin%27||1%3D1%23
```

### Alternative Way.
- Instead of using BURP and URL encoding the payload, you can directly add the following paylaod in the username field.

```
admin'||1=1#
```
