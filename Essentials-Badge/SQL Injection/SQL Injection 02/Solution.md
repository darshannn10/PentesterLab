## Solution
- Visiting the website, I tried performing the same payload I used in the 1st exercise and I got an `invalid credentials` error.
- One thing to notice is that there is no SQL syntax error displayed.
- On trying out `double-quotes(")` we get an `invalid credentials` error but this time, SQL syntax error is also displayed.
- So according the error displayed, the SQL syntax could be:

```
username="___" and password=md5("____") 
```
- So changing the single-quote payload to double-quote, the payload would be:

```
admin" "1"="1 -- 
```

And we're logged in and can retrieve the key.
