## Course
In this example, the error message gives away the protection created by the developer: `NO SPACE`. This error message appears as soon as a space is injected inside the request. It prevents us from using the `' or '1'='1` method, or any fingerprinting that uses the space character. However, this filtering is easily bypassed, using `tabulation (HT or \t)`. You will need to use encoding, to use it inside the HTTP request. Using this simple bypass, you should be able to see how to detect this vulnerability.
