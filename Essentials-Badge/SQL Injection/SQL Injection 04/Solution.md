- Visiting the website and trying to login using `admin:admin`, we can the same `invalid credentials` error.
- So, now, I tried using one of the previous injection payloads I used.
```
admin' or 1=1 --
```
- This gave me an error saying `ERROR NO SPACE`.
- Since the webpage only tries to protect from basic SQL Injection and not completely shutting down the SQL Injection possibility, one thing we can do its, `encoding the spaces` between the characters being sent. i.e using tabulation (%09) instead of spaces.
```
admin%27%09or%091%3D1%09--%09
```
- Once you send the request, you are logged in as admin and can get the key.

NOTE: You might need to `BurpSuite` to edit the request.
