### SQL INJECTIONS
SQL injections are one of the most common (web) vulnerabilities. All SQL injections exercises, found here, use MySQL for back-end. SQL injections come from a lack of encoding/escaping of user-controlled input when included in SQL queries.

Depending on how the information gets added in the query, you will need different things to break the syntax. There are three different ways to echo information in a SQL statement:

- Using quotes: single quote or double quote.
- Using back-ticks.
- Directly.

The way information is echoed back, and even what separator is used, will decide the detection technique to use. However, you don't have this information, and you will need to try to guess it. You will need to formulate hypotheses and try to verify them. That's why spending time poking around with these examples is so important.

In this challenge, you will need to bypass the login page using SQL injection. The SQL query looks something like:

```
SELECT * FROM user WHERE login='[USER]' and password='[PASSWORD]';
```

Where: __[USER]__ and __[PASSWORD]__ are the values you submitted.


The logic behind the authentication is:

- if the query returns at least one result, you're in
- if the query returns no result, you have not provided a valid username and password.

Our goal is to make the query return at least one result. To do so we are going to inject a condition that is always true: 1=1. To do that, we are going to:

- Break outside of the single quote to be able to inject SQL using a single quote.
- Add a OR keyword to make sure the comparison is always true.
- Add our always true comparison: 1=1
- Comment out the remaining query using -- (the space at the end matters) or #.

If we put everything together, we get our payload.
