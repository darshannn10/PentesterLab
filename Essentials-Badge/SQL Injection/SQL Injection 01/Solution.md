On Visiting the website, we get a simple Login page, so, we try to log into the page using common credentials (admin:admin, pentesterlab:pentesterlab).

On submitting the request, we can an `invalid credentials` error.

So, now, I started injecting single-quotes and double-quotes to see if the server complains about it.

Once you input username as `admin'` and enter it, you'll see an error message saying there's an error in your SQL syntax.

Reading it further reveals that the database used is MySQL and it also reveals the part where the error has occured.

The syntax was:

```
admin'' and password=md5('')
```

From the above syntax, we get a pretty good idea about what the SQL query looks like which is really helpful when you want to inkect something. 

So the syntax would probably look like:
```
username='____' and password=md5('_____')
```

So, when we added a single-quote alongside `admin`, we accidently made it close the username parameter and the actual single-quote from the system didn't have any other closing single-quote for it, which made the database throw an error.

this is what it'll look like.

```
username='admin''...
```

The first single-quote is system defined, while the second one is added by us, which makes the database close the parameter value, while there still remains a single-quote, which is actually defined by the system and has no closing single quote which in case creates a SQL syntax error.

So, out goal now would be to properly finish the syntax of the SQL query to avoid the error but also find a way for the database to return the information that will get us logged in.

To do that, we can use a simple trick that create a condition which is always `true` i.e `OR 1=1` because 1=1 is always true and there's also `OR` present so no matter what `OR 1=1` is always going to be true

So the syntax would be

```
username='admin' OR 1=1'
```

Notice the presence of the single-quote at the end of the syntax, we need to get rid of that or close it so that we dont get any syntax error.

So, the final payload would be:

```
admin' or 1=1 -- 
```

Notice, that, there's a space after the `--` sign, so that the SQL query doesnt throw any error.
