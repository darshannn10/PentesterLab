## 1. Sesssion start 
- if the `session[user]` is not set then it's gonna redirect to `/login.php`, which allows us to manage authentication.
- `die()` method is called after that so that code after it is not run if the `session[user]` is not set or if the user is not logged in.
- on line 7, `header.php` is required (called)
- after a few html, on line 14, key to the exercise is displayed.

This indicates that the user needs to be logged in to the website, in order to retrieve the key.

## 2. Header.php
- Loading in some classes (db.php, pfpfix.php, user.php)
- A lot of html to manage the layout of the page.

## 3. db.php
- calling `mysql_connect` to connect to localhost and provide credentials.
- then we select the database using the link in the previous line.

## 4. user.php
- creating a new class `user` on line 4, and defining a static function `logout` to logout of the website, which calls the `session_destroy()` to destroy the current session.
- creating a function named `login` on line 9, defining a sql query which is
```php
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users where login='"
```
- then, adding the user and password that are taken from the input boxes provided on the webpage where password is `md5` hashed directly through the code in the backend.

NOTE: It's better to hash the password in the application before passing it to the database.

- Running the mysql query by using the `mysql_query` and passing the `sql` variable as the input.
- fetching the result obtained using the `mysql_fetch_assoc` with the row login.
- If there is row login, we return true, otherwise, the SQL error is echoed and we return back `false`

## 5. login.php
- firstly, a session start is defined which requires header.php.
- if username and password are set, we call the `user login` with two values: username and password.
- One thing to notice is that there is no filter in the login function and since there's no filtering we probably have an SQL injection.
