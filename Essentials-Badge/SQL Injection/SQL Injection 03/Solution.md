- Visiting the website, and trying to enter common credentials (admin:admin), I got an `invalid credentials` error.
- If we try to login with `admin':admin`, we get invalid credentials along with the SQL syntax error from the database.
- So, I think the database requires the user to enter both the username as well as the password.
- So, I used the same payload, I used in 1st exercise and entered `admin` as the password.

```
admin' or 1=1 -- 
```

- After sending the request, I got an error message saying `MORE THAN ONCE ACCOUNT FOUND`. 
- To bypass this, we can use `LIMIT` function in SQL.
- So, the paylaod would be:
```
admin' or  1=1 LIMIT --
```
- And we can login and get key to the website.
