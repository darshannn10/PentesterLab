## Solution
1. Visiting the web-page and trying to perform the command injection like we did in the previous exxercise doesn't work.
2. The Course note provided to us states that we can use backtick() to execute a command (eg. `command` can execute a command)
3. So Erasing the the IP address and replacing it with `uname`.
4. Executing the above command, we dont get any error indicating the possibility of a `Blind Command Injection`
5. So we try to enter our `score` command to check whether the `Blind Command Injection` exists
6. Once you do this, you wont have any indication of the completion of the exercise but on the exercise will be marked as complete on the main website

## POC
```
https://[REDACTED].so/?ip=`/usr/local/bin/score%20[UUID]`
```

```
$ ping -c 2 /usr/local/bin/score [UUID]        
```
