**GOAL**: To retrieve the key

## Solution
1.  Log in to the web-page using the provided username and password: `user1:pentesterlab`
2. You can then see a couple of links to confidential users 
3. On clicking the user's link, we're redirected to another page `/infos/1`, and clicking on second user, we're redirected to `/infos/2`.
4. Following this, we can change the `/infos/2` to `/infos/3` and see what happens.
5. When we do this, we are logged out of the web-page indicating that we can do the same thing that we did in the previous exercise
6. There's one more feature added to the confidential user's page, and i.e `edit the info`
7. When we click on that link, we are directed to `/info/2/edit`
8. What we can do is edit the link from here and change the value from `2` to `3` so that the final link would be `/info/3/edit` and voila!!! you get the key
