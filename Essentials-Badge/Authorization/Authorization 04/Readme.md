When people started building websites with databases to store information, they had to do write a lot of `SQL` manually. However, some people realized that this was not the best solution and started working on smarter alternatives, building `Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)` to easily query the database without any SQL knowledge.

For example, in `Ruby` (using ActiveRecord), you can do things like:
```ruby
@user = User.find_by_name('pentesterlab')
```
This will automatically generate and execute the query, then retrieve the result in a User object.

Another really handy usage is to automatically create and update an object from a hash:

```ruby
@user = User.create(myhash) 
[...]
@user.update_attributes(anotherhash)
```
Unfortunately, this useful feature comes with a security price.

If a developer did not correctly ensure that attributes of the object `@user` were protected, an attacker could arbitrarily overwrite any of these attributes. In this section, we will see some common examples of these types of issues: `Mass-Assignment`.

In this example, you can register a user. The application has two levels of privileges:

- User.
- Admin.

The admin privilege is set using the attribute admin on the object user. If you look closely at the format used by the web application: user[username] and user[password], you should be able to find a way to get admin access. Three methods can be used:

- Modify the page directly using a browser extension.
- Save the page and modify offline to create a page that will send the right payload to the right URL.
- Use a proxy to intercept the legitimate request and add your parameter (the fastest option).
