**GOAL**: To retrieve the key by finding a way to get `admin` access

## Solution
1. Register on the web-page using any username and password. For simplicity, I used `user1:password`
2. After registering, we get a message saying, `You don't have admin privileges`
3. Setting up the browser to use proxy at port `8080` and using `Burp-Suite` to intercept the traffic.
4. On intercepting the registration request, we see a POST request on `/signup` page, and we see also see a `session id` being sent along withe the username and the password
5. Carefully inspecting the username and password format being sent we figure out that the format is as following: 
```
user[username]=user1&user[password]=password&submit
```
6. What we can do is add `user[admin]=true` to give us the admin privileges as this is how `admin` privileges is given in ORMs.
7. So the entire username & password string to be sent will be as follows: 
```
user[username]=user1&user[password]=password&submit&user[admin]=true
```
8. Once you forward the request, you should have admin privileges and be displayed with the key to complete this exercise
