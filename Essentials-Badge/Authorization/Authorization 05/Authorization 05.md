**GOAL**: To retrieve the key by finding a way to get `admin` access

## Solution
1. Registering to the account using the same `user1:password` credentials, we see the same message as we saw in the previous exercise.
2. Intercepting the traffic throuugh Burp, we see the same type of request and credential string being passed to the database.
3. Adding `&user[admin]=true` to the request and sending it doesnt provide us with admin privilege like it did in the previous exercise
4. Instead of adding `&user[admin]=true`, we can also use `&user[admin]=1` which is similar to `true`.
5. In this way we can achieve `admin` privileges and can retrieve the key to complete the exercise
