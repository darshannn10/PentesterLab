**GOAL**: To retrieve the key by finding a way to get `admin` access

## Solution
1. Visiting the web-page, we see couple of links to different pages, clicking on those linking directs us to `/organisations/1` and `/organisations/2` respectively
2. We can try automatic mapping of the next few pages like visiting `/organizations/3`.... but it's of no use.
3. Registering our account using the same `user1:password` credentials, we get a message stating `You are not part of an organization`
4. Through this we can make an assumption is that we have an organisation and that organisations have users. These users have `username`, `password` and `organisation_id`    

```
organisations --> users

user
  email
  password
  organisation_id
```
5. What we can do in a ruby application is: 
```ruby
user.organisation

what ruby does is --> Organisation.find(organisation_id)
```
6. Intercepting the traffic through `Burp`, we can add `user[organisation_id]=1` after to the `user[username]=user1&user[password]=password&submit+Query` and forward the request.
7. After the request has been sent and validated, we can see that we have become a part of the organisation 1 and can retrieve the key and complete the exercise
