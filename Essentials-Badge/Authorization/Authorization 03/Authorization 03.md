**GOAL**: To retrieve the key

## Solution
1. Visiting the website, we get a simple web-app that contains user's and a `show` button
2. Clicking the show button, we are directed to another page, where we are displayed the email and key, but the key is masked.
3. All the previous techniques of `changing the Urls` to obtain the key doesnt work, neither viewing the `source-code` of the page doesnt reveal the key
4. To reveal/ view the key, all we need to do is to add a file extention to `/users/1` to view the file in different format.
5. We can do this in the following way: 
```
/users/1.js
/users/1.html
/users/1.html
/users/1.json
```

6. Once you view the file in `/users/1.json` format, you'll be able to view the key and can complete the exercise by submitting the key
