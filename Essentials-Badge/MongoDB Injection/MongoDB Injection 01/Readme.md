## Course

This example is the MongoDB version of the (in)famous `' or 1=1 --`.

If you remember what you saw previously, you know that you will need two things to bypass this login:

- An always true condition.
- A way to correctly terminate the NoSQL query.

First, by reading MongoDB documentation you can find that the SQL or 1=1 translates to `|| 1==1` (note the double =).

Then by poking around, you can see that a NULL BYTE will prevent MongoDB from using the rest of the query.

In some cases, you can also use the comments // or `<!--` to comment out the end of the query.

With this information, you should be able to bypass the authentication form.
