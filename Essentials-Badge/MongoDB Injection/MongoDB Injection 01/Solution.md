## Solution

1. When we access the exercise, we see a login prompt, and I tried common credentials `admin:admin` to check how the web-page behaves.
2. As we send the request, we can see that the username and password are sent using the GET request as they're visible in the URL.
3. So we can directly start injecting in the URL instead of sending POST request and intercepting with Burp.
4. Entering a `single-quote (')` gives an error saying `can't canonicalize query`, this is an indicator of presence of `MongoDB` database.
5. So we can use the following payload to retrieve the key to complete the exercise:
```
' || 1==1 %20 
(URL encode it before sending the request).
```
