## Solution
1. Visiting the web-site and trying to login as an AUTHENTICATED user.
2. But this time, instead of having a login page, the user is authenticated in the URL 
```
https://demo.libcurl.so/?name=admin&password=admin
```
3. Now, entering a `single-quote (')` or a `double-quote (")`, doesnt affect the web-site or nor does it give any error.
4. But, however, as soon as we put a bracket, we get a `Bad Search filter` error complaining that the website is unable to reach the `LDAP` Server.
5. This indicates that there is an Ldap injection vulnerability in the application
6. According to the given course material, Ldap authentication mechanism looks like: 
```
(&(cn=(INPUT1))(userPassword=HASH(INPUT2))) 

Where HASH is an unsalted hash (probably MD5 or SHA1).
```
7. Now, all we need to do is inject the payload after the `(INPUT1)` command in such a way that wee complete Ldap query properly.
8. So, we can use `)` after the username input to close the username query properly and then add a NULL BYTE at the end. However, since we also have a password, there would be `&` condition and we'd also need to complete that query too.
9. So the final payload would be
```
admin)(cn=*))%00
```
10. Once you enter this payload, you'd get the key to complete this exercise.
