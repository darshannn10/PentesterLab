Q. What is LDAP?
- Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is a protocol that helps users find data about organizations, persons, and more. LDAP has two main goals: to store data in the LDAP directory and authenticate users to access the directory.

## Course
In this first exercise, you connect to an `LDAP server` using your `username` and `password`.

In this instance, The LDAP server does not authenticate you, since your credentials are invalid.

However, some LDAP servers authorise `NULL` Bind:

If null values are sent, the LDAP server will proceed to bind the connection

As a result, the PHP code will think that the credentials are correct.

To get the bind with 2 null values, you will need to completely remove this parameter from the query.

If you keep something like `username=&password=` in the URL, these values will not work, since they won't be null; instead, they will be empty.
