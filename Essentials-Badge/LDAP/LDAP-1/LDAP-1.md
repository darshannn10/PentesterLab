## Solution

1. Visiting the web-page, we see a login page.
2. Trying to login with common credentials (admin:admin, user:password, admin:password), we see a message that says `You're not AUTHENTICATED`
3. When we look at the authentication mechanism, the main way is to verify through a database or a LDAP server.
4. LDAP is a database that is really quick to query but really slow to insert data.
5. When connecting to the LDAP server, you can do it in one of two ways:

- 1. Using `bind` which the way you connect to the LDAP server
- 2. Search for information i.e query the LDAP server for the information.

6. To complete this exercise, as given in the course, we need to provide NULL username and NULL password to the application
7. When you enter NULL:NULL as username and password, we are still not authenticated, since to enter 2 NULL values, we need to completely remove the username and password field form the request sent, and therefore we'll have to use Burp to modify the request send to theh LDAP server.
8. Intercept the `POST` request of the login form and clear the `username=&password=` and send the request with an empty body to get the key to complete the exercise.
