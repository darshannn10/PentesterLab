## Course

In a similar manner to `Directory Traversal`, this exercise adds its own suffix to the value provided.

As before, you can get rid of the suffix (for LFI) using a `NULL BYTE`.

For RFI, you can get rid of the suffix, by adding `&blah=` or `?blah=` depending on your URL.

In this exercise, the code simulates the behaviour of older versions of PHP.

PHP now correctly handles paths, and they cannot be poisoned using a `NULL BYTE`, as they used to.
