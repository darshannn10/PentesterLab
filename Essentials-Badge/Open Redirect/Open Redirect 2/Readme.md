## Course
In this challenge, the redirect URL needs to start with /. The developer made the assumption that only a path/URI can start with /. However, it's possible to bypass this mechanism by using //. For this challenge, you may want to use another site than webhook.site as they don't automatically redirect http:// to https://. Otherwise, you can use the https:// URL for this exercise.
