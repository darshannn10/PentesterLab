## Solution
1. Visiting the web-page, we're given the objection to find the directory traversal to retrieve the key from the `/pentesterlab.key` file
2. Since we dont have anything value on the page, we start looking at the `image` by right-clicking and opening it in a new tab
3. And we have a parameter attached to the url that fetches the image: `file.php?file=hacker.png`
4. We cannot view the image since the `PHP` probably hasn't sent the correct header to display the picture, but we can still work with it.
5. So, we can start playing and just inject a quote(') to see how the web-page reacts.
6. We dont get anything anymore, indicating that there isn't much filtering going on.
7. So we can inject a `./` before the `hacker.png`, and we can still see the same thing we saw when we loaded the image
8. Looking at the page source, we can see that we are in `/var/www` directory
9. To read the `etc/passwd` file we need to go back atleast 2 to 3 directories.
10. So our command looks like:
```
file.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd
```
11. And we can view the contents of `/etc/passwd` & can confirm that the directory traversal is working
12. So instead of `/etc/passwd`, we can enter `/pentesterlab.key` to see if the key lies in the particular directory.
13. And we are displayed the key once we enter the `../../../pentesterlab.key` command
