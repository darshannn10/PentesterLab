## Course
This example is based on a common problem when you exploit directory traversal: the server-side code adds its own suffix to your payload.

This can be easily bypassed, by using a `NULL BYTE` (which you need to URL-encode as `%00`).

Using `NULL BYTE` to get rid of any suffix added by the server-side code, is a common bypass, and works really well in Perl and older versions of PHP.

NOTE: In this code, the issue is simulated since PHP has had this type of bypass bug solved since version 5.3.4.
