## Solution
1. Visiting the web-page, we're given the objection to find the directory traversal to retrieve the key from the `/pentesterlab.key` file
2. Since we dont have anything value on the page, we start looking at the `image` by right-clicking and opening it in a new tab
3. Viewing the URL, we see that there is no `file extension` at the end of the url and there's also no file path mentioned like the previous exercise
4. Adding `.png` to the file at the end doesnt return anything.
5. What we can do is, use the `%00 (NULL BYTE)` to get rid of any suffix added by the server-side code, as it is a common bypass technique
6. So we can add `hacker.png%00` and feed it to the server and we receive the same same file back again
7. In this way we can craft a payload to retrieve the key to complete the exercise
8. To obtain the contents of `etc/passwd` the payload is as follows:
```
../../../etc/passwd%00
```
9. Replacing `/etc/passwd` with `/pentesterlab.key` returns the key required to complete the exercise


## POC
```
/file.php?file=../../../pentesterlab.key%00
```

```
6*******-6***-***a-***2-********0
```
