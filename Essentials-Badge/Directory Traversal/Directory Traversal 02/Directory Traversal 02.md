## Solution
1. Visiting the web-page, we're given the objection to find the directory traversal to retrieve the key from the `/pentesterlab.key` file
2. Since we dont have anything value on the page, we start looking at the `image` by right-clicking and opening it in a new tab
3. Viewing the URL, we can see that this time, the developer has provided a full path to the image: `/var/www/hacker.png`
4. Using `../../` doesn't seem to work
5. One more technique for directory traversal is to keep the beginning of the path and then adding the payload at the end, to go back down within the file system
6. So the command would be: 
```
/var/www/../../../../../../etc/passwd
```
7. By using this command, we can view contents of `/etc/passwd` and by replacing the `/etc/passwd` with `/pentesterlab.key` we can retrieve the key.


## POC
```
file.php?file=/var/www/../../../../../../pentesterlab.key
```
