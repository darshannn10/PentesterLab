**GOAL**: To retrieve the key from `bashrc` file using `find` & `grep` command

## Solution
1. Deploy the instance
2. Login into the instance with the following credentials: 
```
username: pentesterlab
password: pentesterlab
```
3. After you login successfully you'll see this kind of interface: 
```linux

```
4. Entering `ls` shows us that there is no file in the current directory
5. So, to check where we are currently i.e in which directory are we currently, we enter `pwd`
6. Now, we can look that we are in `/home/pentesterlab` directory
7. So, now we need to go back one directory to see whether that directory contains the key or not
8. We can do this by Entering `cd ..` command. (`..` means go back one directory)
9. Now, Entering `ls` command, we see there are a ton of different user accounts and it might not be physically possible to check all these accounts for the `bashrc` file which is loaded when a user start a new shell. 
10. So we make use of `find` command as we did in the previus exercise
11. But using the `find` command doesnt help us as the `.bashrc` file is made as soon as the user starts a new shell and hence all the users must have started atleast one shell start
12. To solve this problem we can make use of another useful linux command called the `grep` command
13. Syntax: `find /home -name .bashrc -exec grep [PATTERN] {} \;`
- Using `-exec` argument the grep command will be able to check the keywords 
14. Entering the `find -name .bashrc -exec grep key {} \;` command displays the directory which contains the key and also displays the key to the exercise
