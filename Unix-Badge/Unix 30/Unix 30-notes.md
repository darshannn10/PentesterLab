**GOAL**: To retrieve the key using privileges escalation based on misconfigurations of the sudo command.

## Solution
1. Logging into the instance, we look at what we can run using sudo.
2. We see that we can run `setgid` with sudo privilege
3. `setgid` is a bit that makes an executable run with the privileges of the group of the file.
4. So using this info we can create a file that call and reads the contents of the `key.txt` file and output as the outputu of the program
5. To create this program, you can use the following C code:
```c
int main(void)
{
   system("cat /home/victim/key.txt");
}
You can then compile it:
```
```c
gcc -o /tmp/[FILE] [FILE].c

```
Where [FILE] is the filename.
6. Now we can run this file and can obtain the key
