**GOAL**: To retrieve the key using privileges escalation based on misconfigurations of the sudo command.

## Solution:
1. Logging into the instance, we look at what we can run using sudo.
2. We see that we can run `ruby` with sudo privilege
3. To solve this challenge, you will need to use the python command `sudo -u victim ruby`alogn with aprint statement
4. So we use `puts` command which is similar to `cat` in linux
5. Final command is: `sudo -u victim ruby -e "puts 'cat /home/vicitm/key.txt'"`
