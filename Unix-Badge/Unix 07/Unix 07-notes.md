**GOAL**: TO retrieve the key from shells other than bash(i.e zsh, ksh, or sh)

## Solution
1. Deploy the instance
2. Login into the instance with the following credentials: 
```
username: pentesterlab
password: pentesterlab
```
3. After you login successfully you'll see this kind of interface: 
```linux
1efad3904130 login: pentesterlab
Password: 
Linux 1efad3904130 5.10.0-11-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.92-1 (2022-01-18) x86_64

pentesterlab@1efad3904130:~$ 
```
4. Entering `ls` shows us that there is no file in the current directory
5. So, to check where we are currently i.e in which directory are we currently, we enter `pwd`
6. Now, we can look that we are in `/home/pentesterlab` directory
7. So, now we need to go back one directory to see whether that directory contains the key or not
8. We can do this by Entering `cd ..` command. (`..` means go back one directory)
9. Now, Entering `ls` command, we see there are a ton of different user accounts and it might not be physically possible to check all these accounts for the `*sh_history` file which is loaded when a user start a new shell. 
10. So we make use of `find` command as we did in the previus exercise
11. But using the `find` command doesnt help us as the `*sh_history` file is made as soon as the user starts a new shell and hence all the users must have started atleast one shell start
12. To solve this problem we can make use of another useful linux command called the `grep` command
13. Command: `find . -name .\*sh_history`
14. We find the directory in which the `.zsh_history` file is
15. we can look at the contents by using the `cat` command.

## POC
```linux
pentesterlab@1efad3904130:/home$ find . -name .\*sh_history
./victim42/.zsh_history
pentesterlab@1efad3904130:/home$ ^C
pentesterlab@1efad3904130:/home$ ^C
pentesterlab@1efad3904130:/home$ cat ./victim42/.zsh_history 
ls
cp dk.sh dk6.sh
vi dk6.sh 
cd
