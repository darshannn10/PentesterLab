**GOAL**: To retrieve the key using privileges escalation based on misconfigurations of the sudo command.

## Solution
1. Logging into the instance, we look at what we can run using sudo
2. We can see that we can run `vim`(text editor) as `sudo`
3. We can use this misconfiguration to retrieve the key for the exercise in the following ways: 
- `sudo -u victim vim /home/victim/key.txt`

```
sudo -u victim vim 
AND
r /home/victim/key.txt
```
Alternatively we can also add `!/bin/bash` to the vim file and once we escape it we are a `victim` user since it executes the shell as a `sudo` privilege
