**GOAL**: To retrieve the key using privileges escalation based on misconfigurations of the sudo command.

## Solution
1. Logging into the instance, we look at what we can run using sudo.
2. We see that we can run `perl` with sudo privilege
3. We can use this miscofiguration and print out the contents of `/home/victim/key.txt` 
4. We use the following command: `sudo -u victim perl -e "print 'cat /home/victim/key.txt'"`
