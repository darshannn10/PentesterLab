**GOAL**: To read the content of the file `/var/lib/mysql-files/key.txt` using the load_file(...) MySQL function.

## Solution
1. Logging into the instance, we can login to `mysql` as a `root` as there is no password required
2. Then we just need to read the contents of the `/var/lib/mysql-files/key.txt` file to retrieve the key
3. the command to read a file in `mysql` is different 
4. Using `select load_file(/var/lib/mysql-files/key.txt)` we can read the contents of the file and retrieve the key.

## POC
```linux
pentesterlab@95d16f6b4afe:~$ mysql -u root
