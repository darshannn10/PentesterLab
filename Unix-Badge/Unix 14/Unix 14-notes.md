**GOAL**: To retrive the key from the `backup` account of the users created by the `root`

## Solution
1. Logging into the instace, we visit the `/tmp` folder and do not find anything
2.  listing out the hidden files using `ls -lah` command doesnt yield anything thing useful
3. So we visit anything place where `temp` files are stored, ie `/var/tmp`
4. Here, we find the `backup` folder that was mentioned in the challenge
5. Since the file doesnt have and suffix, we can add a suffix to the file by making a copy of backup and add suffix to it.
```
cp backup foo.gz
```
6. We can extract the files by using `tar`: 
```
tar -xvf foo.gz
```
7. After this we can retrieve the `victim's` password from `/home/victim/credentials.txt` file
8. Change to `Super User` victim by using the command `su victim` and entering the password we just now retrieved 
9. Once we are singed in as victim, visit the '/home/victim' directory in the `home` directory and not in the `var/tmp` directory and retrieve the `key`

```

```linux

credentails.txt
pentesterlab@b5518188bfc6:/var/tmp/home/victim$ cat credentials.txt 

Reminder my password is **********
```

```linux
pentesterlab@b5518188bfc6:/var/tmp/home/victim$ su victim
password: 

victim@b5518188bfc6:/var/tmp/home/victim$ cd /home/victim/
