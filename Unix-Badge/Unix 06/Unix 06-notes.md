**GOAL**: To retrieve the `key` from `.bashrc` using the `export` library

## Solution
1. Deploy the instance
2. Login into the instance with the following credentials: 
```
username: pentesterlab
password: pentesterlab
```
3. After you login successfully you'll see this kind of interface: 
```linux
Linux cf179da9b010 5.10.0-11-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.92-1 (2022-01-18) x86_64

pentesterlab@cf179da9b010:~$ 
```
4. 4.  4. Entering `ls` shows us that there is no file in the current directory
5. So, to check where we are currently i.e in which directory are we currently, we enter `pwd`
6. Now, we can look that we are in `/home/pentesterlab` directory
7. So, now we need to go back one directory to see whether that directory contains the key or not
8. We can do this by Entering `cd ..` command. (`..` means go back one directory)
9. Now, Entering `ls` command, we see there are a ton of different user accounts and it might not be physically possible to check all these accounts for the `bashrc` file which is loaded when a user start a new shell. 
10. So we make use of `find` command as we did in the previus exercise
11. But using the `find` command doesnt help us as the `.bashrc` file is made as soon as the user starts a new shell and hence all the users must have started atleast one shell start
12. To solve this problem we can make use of another useful linux command called the `grep` command and we use the keyword `export` to
13. But using the same command as the previous exercise doesnt help us retrieve the key as the `bashrc` contains too many lines of code and particularly 
14. So instead of doing it, we execute the `export` function and then grep out the the particular function that gives the key as the output
15. We do this by using the following command: 
```linux
find /home -name .bashrc -exec grep export {} \; | grep -v GCC_COLORS
``` 
And we receive the key as the output


## POC
```linux
pentesterlab@cf179da9b010:/home$ find /home -name .bashrc -exec grep export {} \; | grep -v GCC_COLORS
export PTLAB_KEY='********-*****-****-****-***********'

```
