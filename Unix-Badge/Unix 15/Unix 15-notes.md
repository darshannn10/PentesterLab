**GOAL**: To retrieve the key by cracking teh password using `John-the-Ripper`

## Solution 
1. Logging into the isntance and checking out all the locations we previously visited, we couldn't find anything or any hint. 
2. We were denied permission to view the contents of `/etc/shadow`file which is a default security practise
3.  Visiting the `/etc/` directory we can see that the `root` has made a `backup` copy of `/etc/shadow` and named it as `shadow.backup`
4. We can retrieve the username and user hash from `shadow.backup` file and can crack the hash using `John-The-Ripper`
5. The command we use is `john hashes`, john can detect most common hashes automatically and can crack the hashes, however sometimes you'd need to provide the type of hash you need to crack
