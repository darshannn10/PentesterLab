**GOAL**: To retrieve the key which is the password of the admin user in one of the local databases.

## Solution
1.  Logging into the instances, you can use `mysql -u root` to enter the `MySQL` database
2. Once you get access to the database, you should be able to navigate it using the following queries:
- show databases;
- use [DATABASE];
- show tables;
- select * from [TABLE];
3. Using the above information and replacing the `[Database]` with `pentesterlab` and replacing `[TABLE]` with `users`, we can retreive the `admin` password which in fact is the key to the exercise

## POC
```linux
pentesterlab@fb38bcbc7596:~$ mysql -u root
