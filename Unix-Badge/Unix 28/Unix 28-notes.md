**GOAL**: To retrieve the key using privileges escalation based on misconfigurations of the sudo command.

## Solution
1. Logging into the instance, we look at what we can run using sudo.
2. We see that we can run `less` with sudo privilege
3. `less` is basically used to read out the contents of a file and is more or less similar to `cat` command 
4. So we can use `sudo -u victim less /home/vicitm/key.txt` to retrieve the key
