**GOAL**: To retrieve the key using privileges escalation based on misconfigurations of the sudo command.

## Solution:
1. Logging into the instance, we look at what we can run using sudo.
2. We see that we can run `node` with sudo privilege
3. To solve this challenge, you can use node -e '...' followed by valid JavaScript code.
You can based your payload on the following snippet to get command execution:

```javascript
var exec = require('child_process').exec;
exec('[COMMAND]', function (error, stdOut, stdErr) {
  console.log(stdOut);
});
```

5. With this information, you should be able to read the key.txt file in the victim 's home directory
