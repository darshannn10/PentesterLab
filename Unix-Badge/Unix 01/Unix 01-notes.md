**Goal**: To read the key that is in the home directory of another user

## Solution
1. Deploy the instance
2. login into the instance with the following credentials: 
```
username: pentesterlab
password: pentesterlab
```
3. After you login successfully you'll see this kind of interface: 
```
Linux 5fb586177bbc 5.10.0-11-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.92-1 (2022-01-18) x86_64

pentesterlab@5fb586177bbc:~$
```
4. Entering `ls` shows us that there is no file in the current directory
5. So, to check where we are currently i.e in which directory are we currently, we enter `pwd`
6. Now, we can look that we are in `/home/pentesterlab` directory
7. So, now we need to go back one directory to see whether that directory contains the key or not
8. We can do this by Entering `cd ..` command. (`..` means go back one directory)
9. Now, again entering `ls` command, we can see two directories, and mentioned in the challenge, the key is in the `victim` directory
10. We can move into the `victim` directory by entering `cd victim` command 
11. Finally, entering `ls` command again, reveals that there is a `key.txt` file which can be opened by using `cat key.txt` command

pentesterlab@5fb586177bbc:~$ cd ..
pentesterlab@5fb586177bbc:/home$ ls
pentesterlab  victim
pentesterlab@5fb586177bbc:/home$ cd victim/
pentesterlab@5fb586177bbc:/home/victim$ ls
