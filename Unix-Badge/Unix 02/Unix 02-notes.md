**Goal**: To To read the key that is in the home directory of another user

Here, the main difference is the `permissions` set on the `victim` directory. This time, you won't be able to list the content of the `/home/victim` directory. But you can still use cat to get the content of the `key.txt` file.

## Solution
1. Deploy the instance
2. Login into the instance with the following credentials: 
```
username: pentesterlab
password: pentesterlab
```
3. After you login successfully you'll see this kind of interface: 
```linux
Linux ed7f70756fe0 5.10.0-11-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.92-1 (2022-01-18) x86_64

pentesterlab@ed7f70756fe0:~$ 
```
4. Entering `ls` shows us that there is no file in the current directory
5. So, to check where we are currently i.e in which directory are we currently, we enter `pwd`
6. Now, we can look that we are in `/home/pentesterlab` directory
7. So, now we need to go back one directory to see whether that directory contains the key or not
8. We can do this by Entering `cd ..` command. (`..` means go back one directory)
9. Now, again entering `ls` command, we can see two directories, and mentioned in the challenge, the key is in the `victim` directory
10. We can move into the `victim` directory by entering `cd victim` command 
11. Here, when we enter `ls` command, we can see that we are denied seeing the list
```
pentesterlab@ed7f70756fe0:/home/victim$ ls
ls: cannot open directory .: Permission denied
```
12. But entering the command `cat key.txt` can still get us the key stored inside the `key.txt` file as there is `no permission` set for the `key.txt`


## POC
```linux
pentesterlab@ed7f70756fe0:~$ ^C
pentesterlab@ed7f70756fe0:~$ ls
pentesterlab@ed7f70756fe0:~$ cd ..
pentesterlab@ed7f70756fe0:/home$ ls
pentesterlab  victim
pentesterlab@ed7f70756fe0:/home$ cd victim/
pentesterlab@ed7f70756fe0:/home/victim$ ls
ls: cannot open directory .: Permission denied
pentesterlab@ed7f70756fe0:/home/victim$ ^C
pentesterlab@ed7f70756fe0:/home/victim$ cat key.txt
```
