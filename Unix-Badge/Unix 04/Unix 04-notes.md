**Goal**: To retieve the key from `.bash_history` using the `find` command

1. Deploy the instance
2. Login into the instance with the following credentials: 
```
username: pentesterlab
password: pentesterlab
```
3. After you login successfully you'll see this kind of interface: 
```linux
Linux 29c582d00e1a 5.10.0-11-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.92-1 (2022-01-18) x86_64

```
4.  4. Entering `ls` shows us that there is no file in the current directory
5. So, to check where we are currently i.e in which directory are we currently, we enter `pwd`
6. Now, we can look that we are in `/home/pentesterlab` directory
7. So, now we need to go back one directory to see whether that directory contains the key or not
8. We can do this by Entering `cd ..` command. (`..` means go back one directory)
9. Now, Entering `ls` command, we see there are a ton of different user accounts and it might not be physically possible to check all these accounts for the `bash_history` file
10. So, we make use of another useful linux command, the `find` command.
- Syntax `find <starting-directory> -name <name-of-the-file>`
11. Enter `find /home -name .bash_history` to find out which users' directory contains the `bas_history` file and visit that direrctory to retrive the key
