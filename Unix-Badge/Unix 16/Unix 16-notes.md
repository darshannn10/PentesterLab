**GOAL**: To retrieve the key by cracking teh password using `John-the-Ripper`

> HINT: 
- if the hash starts by $2$ or $2a$, Blowfish is used;
- if the hash starts by $5$, SHA-256 is used;
- if the hash starts by $6$, SHA-512 is used.
- if the hash starts by $1$, MD5 is used.

## Solution
1. Logging into the instance and visiting the `/etc` directory, we find the same `shadow.backup` like the one we found in the previous exercise
2. We can copy the `victim's` hash and use `John-The-Ripper` to crack the hash.
3. By  looking at the hash and the `HINT` provided, we can confirm that it is a `MD5` hash
4. We can use the command `john hashes` and `john` will automatically detect and crack the hash
