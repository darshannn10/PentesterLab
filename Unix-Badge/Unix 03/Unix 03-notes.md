**Goal**: To retrieve the key from `bash_history` file

## Solution
1. Deploy the instance
2. Login into the instance with the following credentials: 
```
username: pentesterlab
password: pentesterlab
```
3. After you login successfully you'll see this kind of interface: 
```linux

Linux f1a386920c28 4.9.0-8-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.130-2 (2018-10-27) x86_64

```
4. Entering `ls` shows us that there is no file in the current directory
5. So, to check where we are currently i.e in which directory are we currently, we enter `pwd`
6. Now, we can look that we are in `/home/pentesterlab` directory
7. So, now we need to go back one directory to see whether that directory contains the key or not
8. We can do this by Entering `cd ..` command. (`..` means go back one directory)
9. Now, again entering `ls` command, we can see two directories, and mentioned in the challenge, the key is in the `victim` directory
10. We can move into the `victim` directory by entering `cd victim` command 
11. Entering `ls` command reveals nothing, but as the challenge states that we need to look for `.bash_history` file which is hidden from users
12. we can list down the hidden files by using the command `ls -a`
13. Once we do that, we can see the `.bash_history` file in the `victim` directory
14. On entering `cat .bash_history` we can see that the contents of that file and can also find the `key` to the exercise
