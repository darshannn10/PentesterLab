**GOAL**: To retreive the by becoming the `root` user using the `sudo` command

## Solution
1. Logging into the instance, we use `sudo -l` to see what can we do/run to gain `root` privileges
2. We find out that we can run `/bin/bash` as `victim` to gain access to victim account
3. We use the command: `sudo -u victim /bin/bash` to gain `victim's` account privilieges
4. Traversing into `victim's` home folder we can retrieve the key

## POC

```linux
pentesterlab@90fc0b4d7b31:~$ sudo -l

    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
