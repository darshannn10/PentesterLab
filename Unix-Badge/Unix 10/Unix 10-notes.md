**GOAL**: TO retrieve the key from the `zipped backup` file that `root` has left

## Solution
1. Logging into the instance we find out that there's a `backup.tgz` file in the present directory and we can use `ls -ld` command to find out the permissions and the owner of the directory
2. The owner of the directory is `root` and thus might contain the `key`
3. Thus, we need to retrieve the contents of the file, but the file is compressesed(i.e zipped) and we first need to decompress(i.e unzip) it.
4. We can do it by using `tar` command which is a command line tool used to compress and decompress files on a linux system
5. We use the command `tar -xvf <file-name>`
- -x -> extract the contents
- -v -> verbose i.e list down the contents extracted one by one
- -f -> used to specify the file name
6. Once the contents are extracted, we can retrieve the key and complete the exercise
